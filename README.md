# Liverpool | The Six

This is my website detailing the success of Liverpool Football Club in Europe. It includes a welcome page with a welcome section and an introduction box with a link to the main page. On the second page I have made a card system with information on each cup. And finally I have a contact form at the end with a modal once the suibmit button is triggered.
 
## UX
 
UX User stories As a football enthusiast I expect to see results on games and team information. I have included wireframes for this project for desktop and for mobile. I intended to create wireframes for tablet also however during the design phase the desired layout for tablet was achieved without using a wireframe prior to completion. All layout and responsiveness was as expected.

Wireframes can be found in my repository under the filename "milestone1.bmpr"

## Features

Strategy My goal in the design was to make exciting for the user to experience the story of each match.

Scope For fans I wanted take them through the journey of the club and give them a sense of achievement and pride for the club.

Structure In the Welcome section I wanated visitor to get a short intro to what the site was all about and what to expect continuing. From The Six section I wanted them to enjoy the story being pieced together. Finally from the contact page I wanted to enable to user to make contact regarding and suggestions or questions.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - By clicking the begin button the user is sent to "The Six" page. 
- Feature 2 - The navbar collapses when reduced below 992px

### Features Left to Implement
- In the future I would like to create a more interatvie and flowing carousel style for the middle page "The Six".
- I was also unhappy with the final result of the contact page for 2 reasons.
   1. The layer is fluid and reaches the complete length of the screen. I attmpted to amend this but could not.
   2. I wanted to add a modal to the submit button however this was beyond my capabilities as I needed to choose
      between having a required attribute or a modal.

## Technologies Used

HTML CSS Bootstrap (4.1) Features The navbar I got from bootstrap is set to collapse to a drexcioopdown menu when reduced below 992px.


## Testing

Testing Once arriving on the page all Navbar links are linked and active from all pages. The button to link to the six is also active at the bottom of the welcome page. In the contact page the contact form does not submit unless information has been inserted to all fields.

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
