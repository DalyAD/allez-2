Liverpool The Six 
Milestone One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my website detailing hte success of Liverpool Football Club in Europe. It includes a welcome page with a welcome section and an introduction box with a link to the main page. On the second page I have made a card system with information on each cup. And finally I have a contact form at the end with a modal once the suibmit button is triggered.

UX
User stories
As a football enthusiast I expect to see results on games and team information.

Strategy
My goal in the design was to make exciting for the user to experience the story of each match.

Scope
For fans I wanted take them through the journey of the club and give them a sense of achievement and pride for the club.

Structure
In the Welcome section I wanated visitor to get a short intro to what the site was all about and what to expect continuing. From The Six section I wanted them to enjoy the story being pieced together. Finally from the contact page I wanted to enable to user to make contact regarding and suggestions or questions.

Surface

Technologies
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap (4.1)
Features
The navbar I got from bootstrap is set to collapse to a dropdown menu when reduced below 992px.

Features Left to Implement
In the future I would like to create a more interatvie and flowing carousel style for the middle page "The Six".

Testing
Once arriving on the page all Navbar links are linked and active from all pages. The button to link to the six is also active at the bottom of the welcome page. In the contact page the contact form does not submit unless information has been inserted to all fields.

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://github.com/dalyAD/allez-2.git into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type git remote rm origin into the terminal.

Credits
Content
Content from the welcome page was all written by myself. Content from "The Six" was extracted and cherry picked from wikipedia.

Media
All photos were found through google images. Initialy I was unsure of this however I asked a tutor who clarified that copyright would not be an issue for educational purposes.

Acknowledgements
